# SuryaMoviesHub
Surya Movies Hub is a movie streaming application similar to popular platforms like Netflix, built using C#, MVC, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to browse through movie posters and manage them dynamically through CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Project Overview

Surya Movies Hub is designed to simulate the functionality of a movie streaming platform. It allows administrators to manage movie posters and their related information, such as movie details, release dates, and genres. Users can add, update, delete, and view movie posters, making it a dynamic and responsive application for managing movie-related content.

Integrated user authentication and authorization for secure content management. Optimized performance for
smooth media streaming and efficient content loading.

1. User Roles & Permissions:

You can implement different user roles such as Admin (for clients deploying content) and regular Users (who will access and view the movies).

Admin users should have the ability to manage CRUD operations for movies, while regular users can only view the content.

2. Data Validation:

When clients input movie information (release year, trailer link, etc.), ensure proper validation to maintain data consistency. For example, the release year should be a valid year, and the trailer should be a valid video URL.

3. Search and Filter Features:

Include advanced search options for users to find movies based on categories such as genre, release year, or popularity.

Filters can make it easier for users to navigate through a large catalog of movies.

4. Responsive Design:

Ensure the platform is fully responsive across different devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones), making the movie-watching experience smooth for all users.
